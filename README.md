# DeepTVAR: Deep Learning for a Time-varying VAR Model (Li and Yuan, 2022)
## Introduction
We propose a new approach called DeepTVAR that employs deep learning methodology for vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling and prediction with time-varying parameters. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley & Kohn (1986).

## Project structure
This repository contains python code and data used to reproduce results in a simulation study and real data applications.

Here, we brifely introduce some important `.py` files in this project.

- `_main_for_para_estimation.py`: main code for parameter estimation in simulation study.
- `lstm_network.py`: set up an LSTM network to generate time-varying VAR parameters.
- `custom_loss.py`: evaluate log-likelihood function.
- `_model_fitting_for_real_data.py`: model fitting for real data.
- `_main_make_predictions_for_real_data.py`: make predictions using the fitted model.


## Preliminaries
All code was implemented using 
[![Python v3.6.15](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.6.15-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3615/), and Pytorch was used for network training.

Installation in a virtual environment is recommended:
```
#install python with version 3.6.15
conda create --name python36 python=3.6.15
conda activate python36
#install pytorch with version 1.10.2
pip install torch==1.10.2 torchvision==0.11.3 torchaudio==0.10.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
```

The additonal installation of other packages with specific versions can be implemented using
```
pip install pandas==1.1.5 
pip install packaging==21.3 
pip install matplotlib==3.3.4
```
## Usage
#### Simulation study
The following code will do parameter estimation on a simulated three-diemnsional VAR(2) procoess
```
python _main_for_para_estimation.py
```
The output of estimated VAR coefficient matrices and variance-covariance matrix of innovations is 

The training loss function values, estimated trends and pretrained-model file will be saved in the folder `simulation-res`.
#### Real data application
The following code will make predictions from 20 training samples
```
python _main_make_predictions_for_real_data.py
```
The output of forecasting accuracies in terms of APE and SIS at h=1,...,12 is 
```
mape-ts1

```
